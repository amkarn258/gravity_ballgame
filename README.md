# gravity_ballgame

A game where users can see how a ball would fall for a given planet (currently we're just taking g as an input).

Upcoming features -
1. Users will be able to select from a list of different planets, each planet will have a different gravity and background.
2. Users will be able to spend coins for unlocking out of solar system planets.
3. Users will be able to spend coins on different kinds of balls which are falling.
